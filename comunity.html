                <h1>Thunder Story.</h1>
                <h4>Reminder. You are Going To Die</h4>
                <p>
                   Talking about Death.
                   the first impression that comes to you being afraid or you start thinking of it . 
                   its the fear of the end. <br>
                   that you're no longer exist only in those people who loves you but don't worrey that will not last for too long.
                   those people have life to continue and move on ,
                   always Remmember that the mind is a great friend, and always try to protect you from being sad.
                   by forgetting things and move on.
                   heart breaks, Fake friends, waistig money, what you eat yesterday... and <i>"Death"</i> of people we love.
                   so your mind is trying to keep his prioritys clear and only remmember things that he sees important or you need to recall in the future.
                   so things that will disturb you through the way , get thrown in the basket where all your bad thought and things you don't wanna remmember get stored in your "inner mind" .
                   which is the most powerful and controling thing on your self being and your true identity of existance.
                   and one of those bad thought is <i>Death</i> , and the way we accept it . 
                   some people wanna mention it as the end of you , or you're no longer exist and became as a part of the ground , as a part of the mother nature from where we all begin, the starting point .
                   and some other with belives and they rely on something that is more stronger and powerful most of us humans call "God","Lord"... with different prespectives and sometimes you disagree and you start looking at other belifs and wondering.
                   what makes them think that's a god or something powerful, some people make and create with any thing by their bair hands and pretend that's the thing who created them and created the whole univers and belif in theirselfs as that's the thing woh they can rely on at their lowest.
                   to get away bad thoughts inside their mind and give hope for the future to feel safe at the very bad moments and thoughts and to keep yourself out of trouble.
                   im not el religion guy but from my prespective if you do some deep reaearch or by following your heart and think with your mind you will know the truth and the most logical religion that you can put all your belif on. and i think we all know what it is.
                   but in every religion or belives there in some part of their story the idea of stopExisting and the end of the human get mention as <i>"Death"</i>
                   and a most of people will tell you that the human is an important being that god created to test his human true belive in him and there is life after death.
                   and it's a great way to minimize the fear of death.
                   we need to normalize and accept that we're all are going to die one day.
                   but the real fear is what we've done in thos days when we're alive.
                   and hope that we did the best.
                   we forget the idea of living and focus on the end of it.
                   what will happen after?
                   am i going to hell?
                   am i good enough?
                   and knowing well that the life is full of bad people that you can't be a Good person arond, or yo will suffer from them.
                   so focus on your self try to balance your life try to do something that people can remmember your name with, make history!
                   not all of us have those thoughts to be a better person befor Death befor the end of the story.
                   the story just you who know and you're the only one who read it multiple you write it and life choose what you will write about. and at some point you get rid of writing and you lose passion, life leaves you with no jubject to write about you're forced to quit writing.
                   thats when its your time .
                   so you close the book and put your pen down. and rest forever.
                   so what we need to focus on is writing a good book that you enjoy reading it , and memorized to the people who is passing by ,
                   the people who notice those lines of memories and actions . 
                   so enjoy every day even if you had a miserable life.
                   life a good life and enjoy it and stay a good person becaus its not the end.
                   there is <i>"HEAVEN"</i> and <i>"HELL"</i>
